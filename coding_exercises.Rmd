For these exercises, we will be using the **knz_bison** dataset from the **lterdatasampler** package.

```{r}
data("knz_bison")

?knz_bison
```

Create a new column in the bison dataset that calculates the individual's age at the time of observation.

```{r}
# only use year info as month and day info unavailable for animal's birthdate
# animal_yob ~ a number denoting the year animal was born
# rec_year ~ a number denoting the year of observation


```

Write a function that will first filter the bison dataset based on any user-specified weight threshold (returning the filtered dataset).

Create a boxplot showing weight distribution between male and female bison, and then conduct a t-test to see if weight is significantly different between males and females.
